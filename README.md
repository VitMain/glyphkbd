# glyphkbd
The glyph is a completely custom keyboard that combines a 5x13 ortholinear layout with the characteristic arrow/nav clusters from a TKL. Admittedly, it's a somewhat goofy and definitively inefficient layout, but still, it's my favorite I've tried yet. And also, it looks really nice.

### v1
v1 of glyph is a 3d-printed and handwired build. Since it was so novel to me and I didn't know if I would actually like the layout, it made sense to not dive straight in with a PCB and expensive cnc case, instead I went with a handwired, 3d-printed approach.
