the latest build, v1.2 with MT3 3277

# Inspiration
glyph was largely inspired by [drFaustroll's amazing m65](https://mlego.elena.space/m65/) as well as the beautiful [Stucco](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomKeyboards/comments/10k8k6w/custom_ortho_tkl_done_stucco1510/). glyph uses sealing strips as a mounting method, something I learned from [KotteCE's Batoid](https://github.com/kotte-computer-electronics/batoid). I have to say it's the best mounting method I've discovered so far for these types of DIY, 3D-printed handwire boards, far better than my previous experiments. It's dirt cheap, available at pretty much any hardware store, and the sound profile is relatively pleasant also.

# v1
**Comprehensive v1.2 build guide found [here.](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/blob/main/v1.2/v1.2_build_guide.md)**

**Caution: glyph v1 require quite a girthy 3D-printer, you need at least 350x150mm bed area, and the parts are not designed to be split**

v1 of glyph are 3d-printed and handwired builds. Since it was so novel to me and I didn't know if I would actually like the layout, it made sense not to dive straight in with a PCB and expensive cnc case, so for v1 I went with a handwired, 3d-printed approach.

# Future
As you may have gleamed from the fact that I call it "v1", there is more coming for this project. Next step planned is to design and manufacture a proper PCB. Maybe some real plates? This would make my life so much easier when prototyping and assembling these things. I am also upgrading my printer setup to pump these out faster.
If you have any problems, suggestions or questions, you're more than welcome to reach out! I'll be happy to help. Enjoy!
