### Inspiration
glyph was largely inspired by [drFaustroll's amazing mlego m65](https://mlego.elena.space/m65/) as well as the gorgeous [Stucco.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomKeyboards/comments/10k8k6w/custom_ortho_tkl_done_stucco1510/) 

# v1.x
**v1.2 build guide found [here.](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/blob/main/v1.2/v1.2_build_guide.md)**

v1.x of glyph are 3d-printed and handwired builds. Since it was so novel to me and I didn't know if I would actually like the layout, it made sense not to dive straight in with a PCB and expensive cnc case, so for v1.x I went with a handwired, 3d-printed approach. glyph v1.x uses sealing strips as a mounting method, I first learned about this method from [KotteCE's Batoid](https://github.com/kotte-computer-electronics/batoid). I have to say it's the best mounting method I've discovered so far for these types of DIY, 3D-printed handwire boards, far better than my previous experiments. It generally sounds pretty good as well.
