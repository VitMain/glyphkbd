v1.2 with MT3 3277

# Inspiration
glyphkbd was largely inspired by [drFaustroll's amazing m65](https://mlego.elena.space/m65/) as well as the beautiful [Stucco](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomKeyboards/comments/10k8k6w/custom_ortho_tkl_done_stucco1510/). glyph v1 uses sealing strips as a mounting method, something I learned from [KotteCE's Batoid](https://github.com/kotte-computer-electronics/batoid). I have to say it's the best mounting method I've discovered so far for these types of DIY, 3D-printed handwire boards, far better than my previous experiments. It's dirt cheap, available at pretty much any hardware store, and the sound profile is relatively pleasant also.

# v2
glyphkbd_v2 uses an actual PCB, with integrated STM32F072 controller running QMK, with VIA use enabled. 3D printed top mount case.

# v1.x
**Comprehensive v1.2 build guide found [here.](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/blob/main/v1.2/v1.2_build_guide.md)**

v1 of glyph are 3d-printed and handwired builds using a USB-C RPi Pico clone as controller, running KMK firmware
