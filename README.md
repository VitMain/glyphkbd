# glyphkbd
The glyph is a completely custom keyboard that combines a 5x13 ortholinear layout with the arrow/nav clusters characteristic of a normal TKL or 100% size keyboard. Admittedly, it's a somewhat goofy and definitively inefficient layout, but still, it's my favorite I've tried yet. And also, it looks really nice.

### v1
v1 of glyph is a 3d-printed and handwired build. Since it was so novel to me didn't know if I would actually like the layout, it made sense to not dive straight in with a PCB and expensive cnc case, instead I went with a handwired and 3d-printed approach, which I understood better and was more comfortable working with.
