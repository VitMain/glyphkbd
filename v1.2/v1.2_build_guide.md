This page will walk you through the complete process of assembling a glyph v1.2.
Let's start with everything you'll need:

- printed parts: bottom and top case, foot, plate and pico clip
- 3D pen recommended (soldering iron can also work but is more messy)
- 8x M2,5 threaded inserts <10mm length, OD ~4mm
- 8x M2,5x12mm countersunk screws, DIN7991 or similar
- rubber feet, âŒ€20x>2mm, [example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004003601545.html)
- RasPi Pico clone with USB-C, [example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306.html) (authentic pico will not fit, has different dimensions)
- 74 MX-style switches
- 1x 2u plate mount MX-style stabilizer
- at least basic handwiring supplies: axial signal diodes, insulated wire, soldering equipment
- optional but useful: loose hotswap sockets, rainbow ribbon cable

### step 1
The controller of v1 glyph, the pico clone, is held in place on inside of the foot by a small 3d printed clip. In order for this clip to be durable, it has to be printed in the flat orientation, separately. Let's attach it to the foot now:

Align the center divit with the connector hole on the foot, and weld it into place with your 3D pen (or soldering iron, if you must).

### step 2
One of the unique design choices that I made with this keyboard design was to split the bottom case from the foot. This means that we can use this more interesting and proper-looking foot design, we have a nice smooth surface on both the bottom case and the bottom of the foot, and we avoid all of the annoying support material we would otherwise need. This is in my opinion more than worth the small trade-off of having to weld them together on the inside.

Use the 3D pen with some loose filament kind of like a MIG welder, extruding molten plastic into the gap. Before you begin, it's best to make sure that the foot and case are aligned properly with an even gap all the way around. When welding, it's best to go slowly and sort of massage the plastic into both sides of the seam, you don't want a cold weld.
