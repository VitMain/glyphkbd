# v1.2 build guide
This page will walk you through the complete process of assembling a glyph v1.2.
Let's start with everything you'll need:

- printed parts: bottom and top case, foot, plate and pico clip
- 3D pen recommended (soldering iron can also work but is more messy)
- 8x M2,5 threaded inserts <10mm length, OD ~4mm
- 8x M2,5x12mm countersunk screws, DIN7991 or similar
- rubber feet, âŒ€20x>2mm, [example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004003601545.html)
- RasPi Pico clone with USB-C, [example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306.html) (authentic pico will not fit, has different dimensions)
- 74 MX-style switches
- 1x 2u plate mount MX-style stabilizer
- at least basic handwiring supplies: axial signal diodes, insulated wire, soldering equipment
- optional but useful: loose hotswap sockets, rainbow ribbon cable
