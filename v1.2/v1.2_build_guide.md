# v1.2 build guide
This page will walk you through the complete process of assembling a glyph v1.2.
Let's start with everything you'll need:

- printed parts: bottom and top case, foot, pico clip, plate
- 3D pen is recommended (soldering iron can also work but is more messy)
- 8x M2,5 threaded inserts, 5mm length, 3,5-4mm OD, [example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004870993068.html)
- 8x M2,5x12mm countersunk screws, DIN7991 or similar. M2,5x16 will also fit
- rubber feet, âŒ€20x3mm, [example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004003601545.html)
- RasPi Pico clone with USB-C, [example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306.html) (authentic pico will not fit, has different dimensions)
- 9mm P-profile self-adhesive rubber sealing strips, [example](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/RUBBER-IDITATION-Profile-Adhesive-Sealing/dp/B00SM048D0)
- 74 MX-style switches
- 1x 2u plate mount MX-style stabilizer
- basic handwiring supplies: axial signal diodes e.g 1N4148, insulated wire, soldering equipment
- optional but useful: loose hotswap sockets, rainbow ribbon cable

# Printed parts:
![parts](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/assets/134774462/8b6f06a4-b140-4821-943e-2459a2e82ed5)

All of the case parts are printed in PLA and the plate is printed in PETG. Everything is printed with solid infill, to increase mass and improve sound.

# Case
The controller of v1 glyph, the pico clone, is held in place on inside of the foot by a small 3d printed clip. In order for this clip to be durable, it has to be printed in the flat orientation, separately. Let's attach it to the foot now:

![clip_welded](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/assets/134774462/145010a3-818c-457e-8487-431ef72066fd)

Align the center divit of the clip with the USB C hole on the foot, and weld it into place with your 3D pen (or soldering iron, if you must). The Pico should snap in pretty easily and sit snugly. You should be able to release it by putting some pressure on the lever.

One of the unique design choices that I made with this keyboard design was to split the bottom case from the foot. This means that we can use this more interesting and proper-looking foot design, we have a nice smooth surface on both the bottom case and the bottom of the foot, and we avoid all of the annoying support material we would otherwise need. This is in my opinion more than worth the small trade-off of having to weld them together on the inside. If done right, it looks completely seamless from the outside.

![foot_welded](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/assets/134774462/9783d125-4a1c-4f56-9e96-d13fba07e498)

Use the 3D pen with some loose filament kind of like a MIG welder, extruding molten plastic into the gap. Before you begin, it's best to make sure that the foot and case are aligned properly with an even gap all the way around. When welding, it's best to go slowly and sort of massage the plastic into both sides of the seam, you don't want a cold weld.

The glyph v1.2 screws together from bottom to top with some threaded inserts in the top case. Add these inserts now. Simply use a soldering iron to heat up and press your threaded inserts into the holes on the inside of the top case. Depending on the outer diameter of the ones you've picked, it may be necessary to drill the holes in the top case to a larger size.

Add the rubber feet to the bottom

# Wiring 
First, pop all of your switches and your stabilizer into the plate. If you printed the plate with your nozzle a little too close to the bed, you may have to file away the little lip that forms around the circumference of the switch holes before you can pop them in. I've tried enlarging the holes to compensate for this effect, but even 0,1mm leads to switches popping out way too easily. Such is the curse of 3D printed plates... Same applies for the stabilizer. 

![switches_in](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/assets/134774462/9a870f31-f72e-43cc-af58-deec93c721f2)

Next, I like to add hotswap sockets so that I don't have to solder directly onto the switch legs of my precious black inks. This is optional though, if you dont care about them, you can just solder directly onto your switches.

![sockets_on](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/assets/134774462/3624a910-bde1-49e9-933f-bcc340a1f045)

The next step is to solder the diodes, and solder them into rows.

Then the columns. I like to use some rainbow ribbon cable here, it looks dope and helps me keep track of the order when soldering to the controller.

![columns_completed](https://github.com/galile0-designs/glyphkbd/assets/134774462/2098b3f1-3834-492f-930a-3c55f0d0364f)

Now add the sealing strips to the plate. Ideally they should overhang about 0,5-1mm over the edges to help with alignment relative to the case.

Now to wire the board up to the Pico. The standard pinout is as follows, but you can change this easily by just editing the pin configuraton in the main.py firmware file.

yes, spagetti

# Firmware
glyph v1 runs KMK firmware, which makes this really just a drag and drop procedure, no special software required!

First, hold down the bootloader button on your pico while pluging it into USB. It should enter bootloader mode and appear on your system as a flash drive. Now download CircuitPython from [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/) and drag the .uf2 file into the pico flash drive. It will now automatically reboot, and appear as a new empty flash drive now named CIRCUITPY. This drive should contain a file called code.py by default, delete this file.

Now download the KMK firmware repository from [here](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware), and drag and drop the "kmk" folder to the CIRCUITPY drive. Now drag and drop the "main.py" and "boot.py" firmware files for glyph v1.2 to CIRCUITPY. Disconnect the keyboard and plug it in again. Your glyph should now be working.

**IMPORTANT! By default, the boot.py file sets the controller to not show up as a flash drive anymore, in order to avoid annoying file manager pop ups when plugging in. If you want access to the drive later, like for modifying the firmware, simply hold down the ESC when plugging the board in. This will override boot.py, causing it to show up as a drive again.**
